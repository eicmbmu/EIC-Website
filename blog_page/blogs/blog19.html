            <p class="text-lg italic mb-6">"Your network is not about collecting contacts; it’s about building real relationships."</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">You’ve validated your idea, built an MVP, and started executing. Now what? To grow, you need support, advice, and connections. But for many students, "networking" sounds intimidating and awkward.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">The truth is, networking isn’t about wearing a suit and handing out business cards. It’s about building genuine relationships with people who can guide and support you. Here’s how to do it without the awkwardness.</p>


            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Start with Your Own Campus</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Your first and best network is right in front of you. You don’t need to go to big conferences to find valuable connections.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-2"><strong>Who to talk to:</strong> Professors, seniors, alumni, and members of college clubs like EIC.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4"><strong>How to approach them:</strong> Go to their office hours, ask a thoughtful question after a seminar, or just send a polite email asking for 15 minutes of their time to discuss your idea.</p>
            <p class="text-lg bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md"><strong>Example:</strong> A student building an ed-tech app approached their computer science professor. The professor not only gave technical feedback but also connected them with an alumnus working at a major tech company.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Give Before You Get</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">The biggest mistake in networking is asking for something right away. Instead, think about what you can offer. Your time, skills, or even just genuine appreciation can go a long way.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4"><strong>How to do it:</strong> Offer to help a senior with their project, volunteer for an event, or share an interesting article with a mentor.</p>
            <p class="text-lg bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md"><strong>Example:</strong> Before asking a local startup founder for advice, a student followed their company on LinkedIn and shared their posts with thoughtful comments for a few weeks. When they finally sent a message, the founder already recognized them and was happy to connect.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Use Digital Tools Smartly</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Platforms like LinkedIn are powerful, but only if you use them correctly. Don’t just send random connection requests.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-1"><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg ml-3 mb-4">
                <li>Personalize every request. Mention why you want to connect.</li>
                <li>Engage with their content before reaching out.</li>
                <li>Have a clean and complete profile that tells your story.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md"><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of a generic request, send something like: "Hello Mr. Sharma, I'm a student at MBM. I was really inspired by your recent talk on building a SaaS startup. I'd love to connect and follow your work."</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: The Follow-Up Is Everything</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Meeting someone once is easy. Building a relationship requires follow-up. A simple, polite message after a conversation can make a huge difference.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4"><strong>What to say:</strong> Thank them for their time, mention one specific thing you learned, and keep them updated on your progress every few months.</p>
            <p class="text-lg bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md"><strong>Example:</strong> After a chat with a mentor, send an email: "Thank you for your time yesterday. Your advice on focusing on customer retention was incredibly helpful. We’re already planning to implement a feedback form based on your suggestion."</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-6">Networking is a superpower for any founder. Don’t think of it as a transaction. Think of it as making friends in the industry. Start small, be genuine, offer value, and you’ll build a support system that will help you long after you graduate.</p>
